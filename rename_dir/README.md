## RENAME_DIR
The aim of this project is to rename the content of folder, without deleting the
previous name.

It is suggested to make the backup of the files before using the program. The 
program will replace the original files with the renamed file name.

It is assumed that the program is running just outside the folder containing 
data and the user has to give the name of the directory which contains data/files
to be renamed.

This program doesn't exactly rename the file name, it actually add new name with
the existing name of the file with underscore.

### Reason behind this project.
The program is made for files generated from various experimantal test, which
already have certain name with number. In the log book this number have its own
meaning. So, without deleting the old name and adding one meaningful name is the
main goal of this project.

[I have taken some idea from this program](https://github.com/kimlew/python-rename-files)
